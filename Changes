#    - utc_string renamed tz_string
#    - Martijn's test works
# 0.01_10
#    - renamed _simple_utc_as_string to _simple_as_string
# 0.01_11
#    - more oo-like tests
#    - print $set works
# 0.01_12
#    - tz() and tz_change are better defined
#    - offset() works for days/months/years
# 0.01_13
#    - quantize()
#    - the $self->{cant_cleanup} property is preserved across tz changes
# 0.01_14
#    - quantize() tests
# 0.01_15
#    - recur_by_rule started
# 0.01_16
#    - recur_by_rule normalizes parameters to $self timezone
# 0.01_17
#    - recur_by_rule removed ! Date::Set::recur_by_rule works better.
# 0.01_18
#    - POD
#    - tests
# 0.01_19, 0.01_20
#    - more tests
# 0.01_21
#    - changed test offset to +02/+03
# 0.01_22
#    - better test sequence for DST start/end
# 0.01_23
#    - tests
#    - found _simple_spaceship() bug in Set::Infinite::_Simple.pm
# 0.01_24
#    - pass DST start/end tests
# 0.01_25
#    - rrule with 'local time' hours
#    - documented 'utc' option (although it is not implemented yet)
# 0.01_26
#    - added 'weeks' to 'utc'=>0 defaults
# 0.01_27
#    - finished 'utc=>0' code
#    - added 'hours' and 'weekdays' to default 'utc=>0' in order to make RRULE work
#      this actually changes default 'utc' behaviour to zero, since it doesn't make 
#      diference for minutes or seconds units.
#    - duration() now works in 'local time' mode only, since it doesn't know about 'utc=>1'.
#    - all tests pass

#    - requires Set::Infinite v.0.39 - correction in spaceship()
